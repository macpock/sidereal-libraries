During our life as developers and users, we find several features or even needs in software systems. My goal is to bring my solutions to some of that features using good standards, concepts and implementations with the cleanest and easier interfaces so anyone interested can start using them just in seconds.

This is a set of libraries that abstracts and implements common and different features from Swing, encryption, Spring and Hibernate templates, email tools to some other libraries that would be added in the future.

If you get here looking for examples to implement on your systems, feel free to download, test and use them in your projects or even create your own version since they are open source.

The "Sidereal" name is a initiative to give stars names to some of the most representative projects.
